# DS_Algorithm_From_Udemy

This is a online course from Udemy: Data Structures and Algorithms: Deep Dive Using Java. 

I previously learned DS & Algorithm using the Princeton textbook and materials which is more comprehensive and complex than this Udemy Courses. One thing better than the Princeton material in this course is that it doesn't use any external packages like Princeton. All the Data Structures and Algorithms(trees, heap, sort, search...) are implemented inside the JDK. 

By taking this Udemy course I picked up many knowledge I have forgotten or not acquired before. If you are not confident in your coding skill, it is a good preparation before your leetcode cracking.
